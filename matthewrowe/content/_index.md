## Welcome to the Index Page 

This site contains downloadable instruction booklets to help you learn programming.  I have written it for UK based, A level Computer Science students but feel free to use the materials here.  

You can use them in classrooms (printed out) or stick them on a 2nd monitor and simply follow along.

## Why C# Not Python?

I have concentrated on C#, Python is an excellent language for quickly processing large amounts of numbers, it is very powerful.  But in my opinion it is not the right tool for learning.  C# provides a full-stack environmnet which works well with Winforms, Unity and MVC.  Therefore I have opted to concentrate on C#.
